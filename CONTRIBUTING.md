## Stand on AI and generated issues & PRs

We generally don't want to tell you what tools to use (you undoubting minimalistic vi enjoyer), but we ideally want to have clean and minimal code, issues and pull requests. \
For this reason we would prefer AI is not used in the creation of issues and PR descriptions. We don't have the resources to read 50 paragraphs on why changing 5 lines of code makes sense. Only explain yourself if the goal of your implementation is not a no-brainer. \
You are free to use AI to generate your code but we require you to review it before submitting. Nitrox is a special kind of software as it's interacting tightly with Subnautica's code base which makes good code generation difficult. Also keep in mind Subnautica's source code is under copyright and it's prohibited to upload it to an AI. \
As a last note, only place comments on functions which meaning is not obvious. Follow the principle of "A good comment explains the why not the what". A good example for where comments are needed/expected are the Harmony patches.
