  summary: >-
    Hook onto <xref href="SubRoot.OnTakeDamage(DamageInfo)" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref>. It'd be nice if this were the only hook needed, but both damage points and fires are created in a separate

    class that doesn't necessarily finish running after OnTakeDamage finishes. Since that's the case, this is used only to stop phantom damage alerts that the owner didn't register
