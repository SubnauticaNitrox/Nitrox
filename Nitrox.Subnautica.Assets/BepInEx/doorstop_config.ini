# Overrides default Mono DLL search path
# Sometimes it is needed to instruct Mono to seek its assemblies from a different path
# (e.g. mscorlib is stripped in original game)
# This option causes Mono to seek mscorlib and core libraries from a different folder before Managed
# Original Managed folder is added as a secondary folder in the search path
